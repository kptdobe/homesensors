# homesensors

My Arduino project leveraging [MySensors](mysensors.org): a 3 colors dimmable LED with motion and photocell sensors. Colors are configurable remotely via a [MySensors](mysensors.org) gateway (using [domoticz](domoticz.com)) for now.

Typical light with motion detection use case for outside.
