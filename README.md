# homesensors

My Arduino project leveraging [MySensors](http://mysensors.org): a 3 colors dimmable LED with motion and photocell sensors. Colors are configurable remotely via a [MySensors](htt://mysensors.org) gateway (using [domoticz](domoticz.com)) for now.

Typical light with motion detection use case for outside.

Overall [fritzing](http://fritzing.org) diagram of the project:

Followed [this instructable](http://www.instructables.com/id/Enhanced-NRF24L01/) in order to improve wireless transmissions. But will still need to buy a transmitter with Antenna to mount into waterproof box.
